# kong-dong
# is a Thai word; it means 'backlog of books'.
# Your purchased books are waiting for you to read them,
# but all you do is keep purchasing a new one, over and over again.

# Buying the same book again is not fate or funny!
# I've got you, here it is â€” 'kong-dong';
# an app that will help you clear your backlog of books
# and prevent you from buying the same book again.
